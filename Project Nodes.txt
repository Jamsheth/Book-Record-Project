project API's
>>/users
>>/users/:id

Notes:-

>>type npm i express 
>> type npm i nodemon -save-anyname
>>change the script in package.json


/user API:-
>> create a basic server 

>>for storing a datas in database, create a data folder and create file in that(users.json and books.json)
>>gave details about the users in user.json page
>>import the data folder in main page (index.js) by using const {users}=require("./data/users.json")

 >>run the code in thunder client and save the url in collections as users,
  it helps you to run url easily on next time.


HOW TO IMPORT AND EXPORT THE file?

>>first import the router file name in index.js which is called as main file
        const userRouter=require("./routes/users.js")
        const bookRouter=require("./routes/books.js")

>>next you need to redirect the file which mean use the app like [app.use(express.json())]
        app.use("/users",userRouter)
        app.use("/books",booksRouter)

>>next you import the express and user.json file in "user.js" file

>>next you initialize the router like  [const app=express()]
        const router=express.Router()

>>next start your API coding 
        notes:-change the app to router because you changed your file

>> next you need to export the router in users.js file
        module.exports=router

>>next remove all "/users" in user.js because index.js is a base file it have "/users" in redirect 
but keep "/" in users.js
